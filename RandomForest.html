  ><h1 style="color:green;"><strong>Introduction to Decision Trees and Random Forests.</strong><h1

    ><p>Decision trees are a predictive model that uses a set of binary rules applied to calculate a target value. Can be used for classification 
      (categorical variables) or regression (continuous variables) Applications Rules are developed using software available in many statistics 
      packages. Different algorithms are used to determine the “best” split at a node </p>
      
  <h1 style="color:green;"><strong>Classification Trees :</strong><h1
    
  ><p>Classification trees work by using training data to build a model.
      The Tree generator determines:
    <ol> Which variable to split at a node and the value of the split.</ol>
    <ol> Decision to stop (make a terminal note) or split again </ol>
    <ol> Assign terminal nodes to a class </ol> 
  </p> 
  
    <h1 style="color:green;"><strong>Regression Trees:</strong><h1
    
    ><p>Regression calculates relationship between predictor and response variables. 
       Structure is similar to classification tree.Terminal nodes are a predicted function (model) values.
       Predicted values are limited to the values in the terminal nodes. </p>
  
     <h1 style="color:green;"><strong>Decision tree advantages:</strong><h1
    
     ><p>to interpret the decision rules. <br>  
      Nonparametric so it is easy to incorporate a range of numeric or categorical data layers and there is 
      no need to select unimodal training data. <br>
      Robust with regard to outliers in training data <br>
      Classification is fast once rules are developed
      </p> 

    <h1 style="color:green;"><strong> Disadvantages of decision trees</strong><h1
    ><br>
    Decision trees tend to over fit training data which can give poor results when applied to the full data set 
    Splitting perpendicular to feature space axes is not always efficient 
    Not possible to predict beyond the minimum and maximum limits of the response variable in the training data
    
    <h1 style="color:green;"><strong> Random forests:</strong><h1
    ><br>
    Random Forests are an ensemble classifier using many decision tree models. 
    They can be used for classification or regression. Accuracy and variable importance information is provided with the results. 
    A different subset of the training data are selected (~2/3), with replacement, to train each tree 
    Remaining training data (OOB) are used to estimate error and variable importance.  
    Class assignment is made by the number of votes from all of the trees and for regression the average of the results is used.
    <br>
  <h1 style="color:green;"><strong>  Common variables for random forests include:</strong><h1

    •	Input data (predictor and response) <br>
    •	Number of trees <br>
    •	Number of variables to use at each split <br>
    •	Options to calculate error and variable significance information <br>
    •	Sampling with or without replacement 
    <br>
   <h1 style="color:green;"><strong>  Advantages of random forests :</strong><h1
    ><br> need for pruning trees  
    Accuracy and variable importance generated automatically 
    Overfitting is not a problem 
    Not very sensitive to outliers in training data 
    Easy to set parameters
    <br>
  <h1 style="color:green;"><strong> Disadvantages of random forests</strong><h1
      ><br>
    Regression trees can't predict beyond range in the training data In regression extreme values are often not predicted accurately i.e. – 
    underestimate highs and overestimate lows  </p>
